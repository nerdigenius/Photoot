Should the visitor, therefore, intend providing us with his personal data to access such additional services, he will be expressly informed pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 196 of 30 June 2003 &ldquo;<i>Personal Data Protection Code</i>&rdquo; (the &ldquo;<b>Code</b>&rdquo;) and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 &ldquo;<i>General Data Protection Regulation</i>&rdquo; (the &ldquo;<b>Regulation</b>&rdquo;), along with the indication (by way of illustration) of the purposes and methods of using the data by photoot S.p.A., as well as the right to request at any time access to, the erasure of the data or their updating. Any reference to the Code found in the Privacy Policy, and in the Website in general, must be considered valid and effective within the limits and to the extent that the legal rules recalled remain in force subsequently to the implementation date of the Regulation (25 May 2018).<br />The website is not intended for children under the age of sixteen, who are also forbidden from creating an account or otherwise providing their personal data.</p>
